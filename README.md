## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive design

### What I learned

Learned and implemented Sass - variables, mixins. Working with Mobile first workflow is better for faster development. I also implemented BEM for better code understanding.

### Continued development

In the future, I want to work and implement more with grid CSS.
